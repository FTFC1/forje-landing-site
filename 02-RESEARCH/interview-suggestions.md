## Validation Questions for Each Test

For every rapid prototype, we'll ask:

**Completion Rate:**
- Did they actually use it?
- How long did they engage?
- What made them stop?

**Behaviour Change:**
- What specific actions changed?
- How quickly did change occur?
- How long did improvements last?

**Scalability Signals:**
- Which elements required manual intervention?
- What would break with 100x users?
- Where do we see network effects?

**Business Impact:**
- Sales numbers improvement?
- Customer satisfaction change?
- Staff retention effects?

## Rapid Learning Framework

**Week 1:** Build + Deploy
**Week 2:** Data Collection
**Week 3:** Analysis + Iteration
**Week 4:** Scale Decision

Each test should answer: **"Is this solving a real problem people will pay for?"**

## Risk Mitigation

**Tech Debt Avoidance:**
- All tests use existing platforms (WhatsApp, SMS, simple forms)
- No custom apps until we validate demand
- Manual processes acceptable for initial validation

**Resource Protection:**
- Max 2-3 parallel tests at once
- Each test limited to 10-20 participants
- Kill criteria defined upfront (e.g., <30% completion rate)

**Learning Optimisation:**
- Document everything
- Weekly reflection calls with test participants
- Pivot criteria clear before starting
