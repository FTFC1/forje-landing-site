# Retail Market Interview Booking

Join us for a 45-minute interview to share your insights on the Nigerian retail market.

We're keen to understand the challenges and opportunities faced by retail managers and staff, particularly around sales techniques, customer interactions, and training.

Your feedback will directly shape the development of new tools and resources to support the sector. 

Example Questions:
What are the top 2-3 customer objections your team struggles with the most?

What sales techniques (e.g., upselling, cross-selling) have you found most effective in the Nigerian retail context?

When it comes to staff training, what methods do you believe yield the best results for your team?
