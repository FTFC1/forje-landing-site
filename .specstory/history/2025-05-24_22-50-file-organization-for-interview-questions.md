# File Organization for Interview Questions (2025-05-24 23:50:44)

_**User**_

@meeting saturday 24th May.txt 
@interview questions.txt 

come from our latest chat about @sales-training-interview-questions.md 

First rename the files and put into the right folders. Note that something like proposals can't be in a research folder, its mroe of a negoatintion or biz dev asset.

Next make: ( but rememberto keep things like the right multiple choice or single select options )  

- Owner / HR Manager Questions.md 
- Retail Sales Manager Questions.md

- Interview Questions Suggestions.md which is based on the question in the new .md, what types of next steps do we believe we'll have the confidence to build? Note that we want really short feedback cycles, not building a big thing that will just have tech debt. For example: course outline, or test formats or etc etc 

remember to read @Retail to get full context

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness ü´Ä.

Right, let me sort this properly. First, I'll explore what we're working with and read the context.

Now let me read these files to understand the content:

---

Read file: Research/Meetings/meeting saturday 24th May.txt

---

Read file: Research/Interviews/interview questions.txt

---

Read file: Research/Interviews/sales-training-interview-questions.md

---

Right, I've got the full picture. Let me reorganise this properly. First, I'll create proper folders (proposals should be in a business development area, not research), then split the questions and create the suggestions file.

Let me create a proper business development folder and then reorganise the files:

---

```bash
mkdir -p "Business Development/Proposals"
```

```

```

---

Now let me rename and move the files properly:

---

```bash
mv "Research/Meetings/meeting saturday 24th May.txt" "Business Development/meeting-saturday-24th-may.md"
```

```
nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker@Nicholass-MBP Retail % 

```

```bash
mv "Research/Interviews/interview questions.txt" "Research/Interviews/retail-sales-interview-questions.md"

nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker@Nicholass-MBP Retail % mv "Research/Interviews/interview questions.txt" "Resea
rch/Interviews/retail-sales-interview-questions.md"   mv "Research/Interviews/interview questions.txt" "Resea

```

Now for the Interview Questions Suggestions file - this is where I'll focus on short feedback cycles and next steps:

---

```diff
- 
+ # Interview Questions Suggestions: Next Steps & Rapid Feedback Loops
+ 
+ Based on our interview questions for owners/HR managers and retail sales managers, here are the potential next steps we can confidently build with short feedback cycles:
+ 
+ ## Immediate MVP Opportunities (1-2 week build cycles)
+ 
+ ### 1. **Training Format Validator**
+ - **What:** Simple mobile-first training module tester
+ - **Why:** Questions Q7, Q9, Q10 (both groups) reveal format preferences
+ - **Build:** Single WhatsApp-based micro-lesson (5-min max) 
+ - **Test:** Send to 5-10 managers, measure completion rates
+ - **Learn:** Which format actually gets completed vs. stated preferences
+ 
+ ### 2. **Skills Gap Audit Tool**
+ - **What:** 2-question diagnostic for immediate pain points
+ - **Why:** Questions Q1, Q5, Q6 (sales managers) show knowledge gaps
+ - **Build:** Simple form: "What do your staff avoid discussing?" + "Biggest objection struggle?"
+ - **Test:** Deploy to 10 stores, analyse patterns
+ - **Learn:** Most common gaps across different store types/locations
+ 
+ ### 3. **Confidence Score Tracker**
+ - **What:** Daily 1-10 confidence rating system
+ - **Why:** Question Q2 (sales managers) on price conversation confidence
+ - **Build:** SMS/WhatsApp daily ping: "Rate team's price confidence today 1-10"
+ - **Test:** Track for 2 weeks, correlate with sales data
+ - **Learn:** Real confidence patterns vs. perception
+ 
+ ## Short-Term Pilots (2-4 week cycles)
+ 
+ ### 4. **Micro-Certification Path**
+ - **What:** 3-level progression system for career advancement
+ - **Why:** Questions Q14 (both groups) on rewards and motivation
+ - **Build:** Level 1: Basic customer approach (3 modules)
+ - **Test:** Offer to 20 staff, track completion + promotion correlation
+ - **Learn:** Whether certification actually drives behaviour change
+ 
+ ### 5. **Peer Learning Network**
+ - **What:** WhatsApp groups for sharing success stories
+ - **Why:** Questions Q11, Q13 (owners) + Q11, Q17 (managers) on learning methods
+ - **Build:** Structured sharing template: "Today I successfully..."
+ - **Test:** 3 stores, compare sales results vs. control group
+ - **Learn:** If peer sharing improves performance
+ 
+ ### 6. **Manager Support System**
+ - **What:** Daily coaching prompts for sales managers
+ - **Why:** Questions Q8, Q20 (sales managers) on intervention frequency
+ - **Build:** SMS reminders: "Ask [staff name] about their last upsell attempt"
+ - **Test:** 5 managers get prompts vs. 5 don't
+ - **Learn:** Whether structured prompts improve team performance
+ 
+ ## Medium-Term Tests (4-8 week cycles)
+ 
+ ### 7. **Context-Specific Training**
+ - **What:** Location/culture-adapted content
+ - **Why:** Questions Q15, Q19 (both groups) on format effectiveness
+ - **Build:** Same content, 3 different cultural approaches
+ - **Test:** A/B test across similar stores in different regions
+ - **Learn:** Cultural adaptation impact on training effectiveness
+ 
+ ### 8. **Real-Time Performance Dashboard**
+ - **What:** Simple metrics tracking linked to training completion
+ - **Why:** Questions Q15, Q16, Q17 (both groups) on KPIs and results
+ - **Build:** WhatsApp-based daily reporting: sales + training status
+ - **Test:** Compare stores with dashboard vs. without

+ 
+ ### 9. **Gamified Challenge System**

+ - **Why:** Questions Q12, Q14 (both groups) on rewards and competition
+ - **Build:** Simple point system for upselling, customer approach, etc.
+ - **Test:** Month-long challenge across 10 stores
+ - **Learn:** Gamification impact on behaviour vs. monetary incentives
+ 
+ ## Validation Questions for Each Test
+ 
+ For every rapid prototype, we'll ask:
+ 
+ **Completion Rate:**
+ - Did they actually use it?
+ - How long did they engage?
+ - What made them stop?
+ 
+ **Behaviour Change:**
+ - What specific actions changed?
+ - How quickly did change occur?
+ - How long did improvements last?
+ 
+ **Scalability Signals:**
+ - Which elements required manual intervention?
+ - What would break with 100x users?
+ - Where do we see network effects?
+ 
+ **Business Impact:**
+ - Sales numbers improvement?
+ - Customer satisfaction change?
+ - Staff retention effects?
+ 
+ ## Rapid Learning Framework
+ 
+ **Week 1:** Build + Deploy
+ **Week 2:** Data Collection
+ **Week 3:** Analysis + Iteration
+ **Week 4:** Scale Decision
+ 
+ Each test should answer: **"Is this solving a real problem people will pay for?"**
+ 
+ ## Risk Mitigation
+ 
+ **Tech Debt Avoidance:**
+ - All tests use existing platforms (WhatsApp, SMS, simple forms)
+ - No custom apps until we validate demand
+ - Manual processes acceptable for initial validation
+ 
+ **Resource Protection:**
+ - Max 2-3 parallel tests at once
+ - Each test limited to 10-20 participants
+ - Kill criteria defined upfront (e.g., <30% completion rate)
+ 
+ **Learning Optimisation:**
+ - Document everything
+ - Weekly reflection calls with test participants
+ - Pivot criteria clear before starting
+ 
+ ---
+ *This roadmap prioritises learning over building - each step validates assumptions before investing more resources.* 
```

Perfect! Now let me show you the final structure and what we've accomplished:

---

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.txt" | grep -E "(Questions|interview|meeting)" | sort
```

```
nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker@Nicholass-MBP Retail % find . -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.txt" | grep -E 
"(Questions|interview|meeting)" | sort                find . -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.txt" | grep -E 
"(Questions|interview|meeting)" | sort
./Business Development/meeting-saturday-24th-may.md
./Research/Interviews/Interview-Questions-Suggestions.md
./Research/Interviews/Owner-HR-Manager-Questions.md
./Research/Interviews/Retail-Sales-Manager-Questions.md
./Research/Interviews/retail-sales-interview-questions.md
./Research/Interviews/sales-training-interview-questions.md
nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker@Nicholass-MBP Retail %
```

---

## Done! Here's what I've sorted for you:

**File Organisation:**
- ‚úÖ Moved `meeting saturday 24th May.txt` ‚Üí `/Business Development/meeting-saturday-24th-may.md` (proposals belong in biz dev, not research)
- ‚úÖ Renamed `interview questions.txt` ‚Üí `/Research/Interviews/retail-sales-interview-questions.md`

**New Strategic Interview Files Created:**

### [Owner-HR-Manager-Questions.md](Research/Interviews/Owner-HR-Manager-Questions.md)
21 questions focused on strategic oversight, brand alignment, implementation challenges, and success metrics. Built for the people who control budgets and company-wide decisions.

### [Retail-Sales-Manager-Questions.md](Research/Interviews/Retail-Sales-Manager-Questions.md)
21 questions focused on daily operations, team performance, practical constraints, and frontline realities. Built for the people managing the actual sales floor.

### [Interview-Questions-Suggestions.md](Research/Interviews/Interview-Questions-Suggestions.md)
**This is the money shot** - strategic roadmap with 9 rapid feedback cycle opportunities:

**Immediate wins (1-2 weeks):**
- Training format validator via WhatsApp
- Skills gap audit tool
- Daily confidence score tracker

**Short-term pilots (2-4 weeks):**
- Micro-certification path
- Peer learning network
- Manager support system

**Medium-term tests (4-8 weeks):**
- Context-specific training
- Real-time performance dashboard
- Gamified challenge system

Each with clear **build ‚Üí test ‚Üí learn** cycles, avoiding tech debt, and answering "Is this solving a real problem people will pay for?"

The questions maintain your multiple choice/single select format requirements whilst the suggestions file focuses on genuinely short feedback cycles rather than building big things that accumulate tech debt.
