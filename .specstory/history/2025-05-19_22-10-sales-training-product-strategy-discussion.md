You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

You asked me to read the file Meeting 002.md.

Summary:
- This is a transcript of a business/product strategy conversation between Nicholas Folarin-Coker and Timilehin Tikolo (and a few others).
- The main focus is on building a retail sales training product/service, with two main pillars: consulting and training.
- There’s a strong emphasis on:
  - Sales training as the MVP (most in-demand, fastest to revenue, most scalable).
  - Gathering raw data via interviews with key stakeholders (store managers, HR, etc.) to localise and differentiate the training.
  - Deliverables: a landing page, a one-pager with up to 25 structured questions for interviews, and possibly a calendar booking page.
  - The need for rapid iteration: ship a basic landing page and question set ASAP, then refine.
  - The importance of understanding assumptions (e.g., number of sales staff, access to smartphones, delivery format).
  - The plan to use interviews (voice notes, calls) to gather insights for the training content.
  - The sales training will be split into two roles: shop floor staff and managers (with managers getting extra admin/KPI content).
  - The six-month business management offer is discussed, but the MVP focus is on sales training for now.

Key actionable points:
- Build a basic landing page for the business (FORJE/Forge).
- Draft a one-pager with up to 25 structured questions for stakeholder interviews.
- Possibly set up a simple calendar booking system for interviews.
- Focus on sales training as the first product, with content tailored from real interviews.
- Use rapid, iterative feedback to improve deliverables.

If you want a specific output (e.g., the 25 questions, a landing page scaffold, or a visual flow), let me know your priority.

Attached is the prospectus that has been made with branding guidlines. Let's first try to describe and wireframe the landing page. Must be focused on our first module: Sales training. @_chat 2.txt  has the whatsapp chat

**Restated Query:**  
You want a concise, visually-structured description and wireframe for a FORJE landing page, focused on the first module: Sales Training. The design/branding should match the prospectus (black, purple, white, Neue Montreal/Avenir fonts, soft gradients). The content should be direct, MVP-style, and conversion-focused.

---

## 1. Landing Page Description (FORJE Sales Training MVP)

**Goal:**  
- Instantly communicate FORJE’s value in upskilling retail sales teams in West Africa.
- Drive interest/sign-ups for the Sales Training module.
- Look credible, modern, and “simply genius”.

**Core Sections (in order):**

1. **Hero Section**
   - Logo (top left)
   - Headline: “Unlock World-Class Retail Sales Skills”
   - Subheadline: “FORJE’s Sales Training Academy – Built for Africa’s Fastest-Growing Market”
   - CTA: “Register Interest” (button, scrolls to form)
   - Visual: Subtle purple/black gradient background, maybe a photo of a smiling retail associate (matching prospectus style)

2. **Why Sales Training?**
   - 2–3 bullet stats (from prospectus):
     - “60% of Nigerians are under 25 – massive entry-level pool”
     - “6 in 10 graduates lack job-ready service skills”
     - “Front-line turnover exceeds 30% annually”
   - Short paragraph: “Retailers face a critical skills gap. FORJE bridges it with practical, localised training.”

3. **What You Get**
   - 3–4 feature cards (icons or simple boxes):
     - “Practical, scenario-based learning”
     - “Localised for West African retail”
     - “Covers sales, customer experience, and store leadership”
     - “Track progress and performance”

4. **How It Works**
   - 3-step visual flow (horizontal or vertical):
     1. “Sign up your team”
     2. “Complete interactive modules (online or in-person)”
     3. “Get certified, boost sales, and track results”

5. **Who’s It For?**
   - Quick bullets: “Retailers, Store Managers, Sales Associates, HR Leaders”

6. **About FORJE**
   - 2–3 lines: “Lagos-based, global standards. Blending decades of retail, tech, and hospitality experience.”

7. **Register Interest / Contact**
   - Simple form: Name, Email, Company, Role, [optional: WhatsApp]
   - CTA: “Get Early Access” or “Book a Call”
   - Contact details (from prospectus)

8. **Footer**
   - Logo, social links, copyright

the issue is that we haven't laucnhed so we have no claims yet

_**Assistant**_

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

**Restated:**  
You want a landing page that builds trust and credibility, but you have no client logos, testimonials, or “proof” claims yet—since FORJE hasn’t launched.

## 80/20 Solution: “Pre-Launch Trust” Wireframe

**Key Principles:**
- Don’t fake traction—focus on vision, credibility, and transparency.
- Use “social proof by association” (e.g., founder experience, partnerships, press mentions, or even “inspired by”).
- Make your process, values, and local relevance ultra-clear.
- Invite early adopters to “shape the future” with you.
