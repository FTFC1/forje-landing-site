# Drafting Interview Questions in Markdown (2025-05-20 12:05:02)

_**User**_

Let's draft the intereview questions in a .md file 

Read all @_chat 2.txt and @Meeting 002.md so you understand 

---

_**Assistant**_

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness ü´Ä.

**Restated Query:**  
You want a concise, structured set of interview questions (in a .md file) for your retail sales training research, based on the full context of your WhatsApp chat (`_chat 2.txt`) and the detailed meeting transcript (`Meeting 002.md`). The questions should be ready to send to stakeholders/experts for input, and should reflect the real needs, gaps, and delivery challenges discussed.

**Approach:**  
- I‚Äôll extract the key themes and requirements from both files.
- I‚Äôll structure the questions into logical sections (e.g. Temperature Check, Current Practice, Gaps, Delivery Preferences, etc.).
- I‚Äôll keep it under 25 questions, as agreed in your meeting.
- The file will be clear, direct, and ready for use in interviews or as a pre-call prep doc.

**Key Insights from Your Files:**
- Focus is on sales training for retail (frontline staff + managers).
- Need to understand current sales practices, pain points, and delivery preferences.
- Questions should be mobile-first, practical, and avoid fluff.
- You want to capture both qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. scale questions, open-ended).
- The goal is to build a product that‚Äôs actually used, not just ‚Äúlooks nice‚Äù.

**Next Step:**  
I‚Äôll create a new file (e.g. `sales-training-interview-questions.md`) with a concise, structured set of questions, grouped by theme, and formatted for easy use.

Let‚Äôs get it done. ü§ñ
