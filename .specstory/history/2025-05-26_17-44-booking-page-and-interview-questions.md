Okay, I'll help you craft a description and some sample questions for your "Retail Market Interviews".

First, I'll have a look inside your `Retail` directory to see if your cousin's interview list or any other useful documents are in there.

---

Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file '/Users/nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker/Documents/PARA/Projects/My Digital Economy/üî≠ Creations*/Proto Studio/New Venture/Retail/Retail'

---

It seems I couldn't directly access the `Retail` directory with that path. Let me try listing the contents of the workspace root to understand the structure better.

Okay, it looks like the `Retail` directory is the root of your workspace, not a subdirectory within it. My mistake!

Now, let's look for that interview list. I'll search for files that might contain "interview" or "questions".

Great! It looks like we have a few potentially relevant files in the `02-RESEARCH` directory:
* `interview-hr-owners.md`
* `interview-sales-staff.md`
* `interview-suggestions.md`
* `interview-training-needs.md`
* `interview-retail-managers.md`
* `/Research/Interviews/Interview-Questions-Suggestions.md` (This seems like an older path, but might still be relevant)

To get started, I'll read `interview-suggestions.md` as it sounds like a good general source for questions. I'll also read `interview-retail-managers.md` as that seems very relevant to "Retail Market Interviews".

---

Read file: 02-RESEARCH/interview-suggestions.md

---

Read file: 02-RESEARCH/interview-retail-managers.md

---

This is excellent! Both files provide a wealth of information.

Here's a draft description for your Google Calendar booking page, and some sample questions drawing from both the `interview-suggestions.md` and `interview-retail-managers.md` files.

**Description for Google Calendar Page:**

"Join us for a 45-minute interview to share your insights on the Nigerian retail market. We're keen to understand the challenges and opportunities faced by retail managers and staff, particularly around sales techniques, customer interactions, and training. Your feedback will directly shape the development of new tools and resources to support the sector."

**Sample Interview Questions (General for Retail Market Interviews):**

These questions aim to get a mix of current practices, challenges, and preferences.

1.  **Understanding Current Sales Approaches:**
    *   "What sales techniques do your team currently use most often (e.g., upselling, cross-selling)?" (from `interview-retail-managers.md, Q1`)
    *   "Can you describe a recent situation where a staff member handled a customer interaction particularly well? What made it effective?" (based on `interview-retail-managers.md, Q3`)

2.  **Identifying Pain Points & Skill Gaps:**
    *   "What are the top 2-3 customer objections your team struggles with the most (e.g., price, product availability)?" (from `interview-retail-managers.md, Q6`)
    *   "Are there any product details or types of customer conversations that staff tend to avoid due to a lack of confidence or knowledge?" (based on `interview-retail-managers.md, Q5`)
    *   "In your experience, what makes price-related conversations difficult for sales staff?" (from `interview-retail-managers.md, Q2`)

3.  **Exploring Training & Development Needs:**
    *   "If you were to introduce a new training initiative, what's the maximum amount of time your staff could realistically dedicate to it during work hours on a weekly or monthly basis?" (based on `interview-retail-managers.md, Q10 & Q12`)
    *   "When it comes to training, what methods have you found to be most effective for your team (e.g., short mobile lessons, in-person workshops, peer learning)?" (based on `interview-retail-managers.md, Q9 & Q11` and `interview-suggestions.md` - Peer Learning Network)
    *   "What are the biggest hurdles you face when trying to implement new training or ensure that staff apply what they've learned?" (from `interview-retail-managers.md, Q19`)

4.  **Gauging Interest in Potential Solutions (from `interview-suggestions.md`):**
    *   "How valuable would your team find very short, mobile-first training modules (e.g., 5-10 minute videos or activities) that they could complete on their phones?" (related to 'Training Format Validator')
    *   "Would a simple tool to quickly identify common skill gaps or customer objection patterns within your team be useful?" (related to 'Skills Gap Audit Tool')
    *   "Are you interested in exploring systems that encourage peer-to-peer learning, where staff can share successful sales strategies or tips with each other?" (related to 'Peer Learning Network')

**Key Considerations for Your Interviews:**

*   **Focus on Nigeria:** Remember to tailor questions to the specific context of the Nigerian retail market. The image mentions "45 Min interview about Retail in Nigeria."
*   **Open-Ended is Good:** Encourage detailed responses. The sample questions provided are a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended, lean into the open-ended ones for richer insights.
*   **Iterative Mindset:** These questions are a starting point. Based on the initial interviews, you might identify new areas to explore.

Let me know what you think, and if you'd like me to refine these or look into other files!

Alright, I'll create a `booking-description.md` file in the `04-ASSETS` directory with the description we drafted. This seems like the most logical place for a file like this.

You're right, adding a few sample questions to the booking description will give potential interviewees a better idea of what to expect.

I'll add three questions to the `04-ASSETS/booking-description.md` file.
