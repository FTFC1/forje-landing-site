## Project Status: Research Phase
**Last Updated:** Dec 2024

## What We're Building
Mobile-first training platform for retail sales staff - targeting skill gaps in customer engagement, product knowledge, and sales conversion.

## Key Insights from Research

- Mobile training preferred (5-10 min modules)  
- Need brand-customised content
- Focus on behavioural change, not just knowledge transfer

## Next Actions

2. Validate training content priorities
3. Design MVP mobile experience
4. Partnership development (LBS/FORJE)

## Revenue Model
B2B SaaS - training licences per retail location
